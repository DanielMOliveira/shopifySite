However, we do have a few recommendations for maintaining the integrity of your items: <br/>- When washing your clothes, you should separate them into different colours and, depending on how dirty they are, avoid exposing them to longer cycles than necessary; <br/>- Washing at high temperatures damages the integrity of fabrics and makes colours less vibrant, so try to wash at low temperatures;<br/>- Exposure to direct sunlight causes colours to wear out, so try to dry them in environments that are protected from sunlight;<br/>- Detergent is a cleaning agent, but it can also cause abrasion to fabrics, so try to use the recommended doses and never too much; <br/>- For best results in a wash cycle, try not to fill the drum completely, so that the clothes can move freely, allowing for better sanitising and washing. </p>"
